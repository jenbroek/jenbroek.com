For Christmas (2024), I attempted the infamous Beef Wellington. To my surprise, it wasn't all that difficult!

The lattice didn't turn out as well as I'd have liked as I made it by hand,
and I used a little too much duxelles, but otherwise it was delicious.

For my second attempt, during New Year's Eve, I couldn't get my hands on filet mignon in time so I used pork tenderloin.
It was good, but would've benefitted from grainy mustard instead, and some apple mixed into the duxelles I think.

My third attempt, using chuck tender, was the best looking yet. Though the meat was, predictably, a bit tougher and dry.
I think a wet brine next time might do the trick.
