==Highlights:==

==Adventures:==
- Walked the Freedom Trail
- Frequented the North End for its infamous cannoli (Modern Pastry beats Mike's, btw.)
- Attended St. Anthony's Feast
- Had clam strips from Sullivan's at Castle Island, per friends' recommendation
- Harvard Museums of Science & Culture (The Glass Flowers Gallery was mindblowing!)

Watched docuseries about Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum robbery on the flight back home,
wishing I'd went there too! All the more reason to visit again!
