For Christmas (2024), I tried my hand at the infamous Beef Wellington. To my surprise, it wasn't all that difficult!

## Traditional
Even though the lattice didn't turn out as well as I'd have liked, and I used a little too much duxelles, it was still delicious.
I made the lattice by hand but for next Christmas I'm buying a lattice roller.

## Pork
I couldn't get my hands on filet mignon on New Year's Eve, so I used pork tenderloin. It was good, but
would've benefitted from grainy mustard instead, and some apple mixed into the duxelles I think.
Definitely a viable alternative for small microwave ovens!

## Chuck
I also attempted using chuck tender. It was the best looking yet.
Though the meat was, predictably, a bit tougherâ€¦ and dry.
I think a wet brine next time will do the trick.
