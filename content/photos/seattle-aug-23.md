Last year I went on my first long-distance solo trip, to Seattle and Boston.
Coincidentally, it was my first time flying too!

I met up with a friend in Seattle who took me to his favourite Mexican restaurant (Mi Tierra)
where I had the most delicious tacos I've ever had, and equally amazing churros. We also took
a ferry to the very quaint Whidbey Island. I half-jokingly remarked that I would retire there.

# Hiking
The highlight for me was hiking to the Mt. Fremont Fire Lookout and Third Burroughs Mountain.
It was tricky getting there with an electric car as we worried we wouldn't have enough remaining
power for the trip back, but ~~aggressive~~ regenerative breaking took care of that. The views,
the fresh air rushing by, the wildlife (admittedly mostly squirrels)â€¦ stunning. Pretty sure if I
lived nearby, I'd be there as often as possible!

# Museums
After that I saw my friend off as he traveled by train to Boston, and I stayed about a week
or so longer to explore Seattle on my own. I visited some museums: Chihuly Garden and Glass,
the Museum of Flight, and the Museum of Pop Culture.
