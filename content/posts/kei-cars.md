I've never been much of a car person but whenever someone asks me what my dream car would be,
I would describe it as "those compact Japanese ones or a similar sleek yet compact style".

Well recently I learned there's a term for that specific category: [**kei cars**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_car)!

I think they're just so neat! Compact and very functional, cute yet cool. I'd love to own
a **Suzuki Cappuccino**, for example. I don't have my license yet (haven't found a need to),
but who knows maybe one day!
