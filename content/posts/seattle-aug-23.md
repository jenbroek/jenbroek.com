Last year I went on my first long-distance solo trip, to **Seattle** and **Boston**.
Coincidentally, it was my first time flying too!

I met up with a friend in Seattle who took me to his favourite Mexican restaurant (**Mi Tierra**)
where I had the most delicious tacos I've ever had, and equally amazing churros. We also took
a ferry to the very quaint **Whidbey Island**. I half-jokingly remarked that I would retire there.

# Hiking

The highlight for me was hiking to the **Mt. Fremont Fire Lookout** and **Third Burroughs Mountain**.
It was tricky getting there with an electric car as we worried we wouldn't have enough remaining
power for the trip back, but ~~aggressive~~ regenerative breaking took care of that. The views,
the fresh air rushing by, the wildlife (admittedly mostly squirrels)â€¦ stunning. Pretty sure if I
lived nearby, I'd be there as often as possible!

# Museums

After that I saw my friend off as he traveled by train to **Boston**, and I stayed about a week
or so longer to explore Seattle on my own. I visited some museums: **Chihuly Garden and Glass**,
the **Museum of Flight**, and the **Museum of Pop Culture**.
